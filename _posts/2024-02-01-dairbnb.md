### About
Dairbnb is an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) clone I built as a student at [AppAcademy](https://www.appacademy.io/). Through this project I learned about writing a backend API using Express.js, interfacing the database using Sequelize (ORM), and fetching this data to the React frontend to display data to users. Not only was I able to learn a lot about full stack development, I made it Super Smash Bros. Melee themed which made the process of completing the project more enjoyable.
