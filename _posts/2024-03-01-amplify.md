### About
Amplify is a [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) clone I built as a student at [AppAcademy](https://www.appacademy.io/). This was my first project at AppAcademy where I worked alongside other developers. We were given one week to deliver a full-stack application.

Key takeaways (skills learned) from this project:
* Using git branches so different features could concurrently be worked on.
* Project management (assigning / delegating tasks to other team members)
* Pair programming with fellow developers.
